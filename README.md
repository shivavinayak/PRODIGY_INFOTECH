# PRODIGY_INFOTECH


This is an internship project given by my company named Prodigy Infotech.

I made a Password complexity checker using python using re which means regular expression, which is a python module.

Its Key Features:

1. Checks for the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

2. Ensures a minimum length requirement for passwords.
